    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the modern age, the internet has set down deep roots within society, letting humans communicate their experiences and opinions across the globe. However, an interesting phenomena that has reared it's head over the last couple of decades has been the differing opinions of professional critics and your average consumer when it comes to reviewing entertainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the theory that the quality and review of the entertainment correlates with the amount of sales, then who is correct in this assumption?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, I am going to dive into the video game market, and study if there is a correlation between the sales amount and the review score of both the consumer and the critic.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be documenting each step of my study, for educational purposes.\n",
