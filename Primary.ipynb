    "In the modern age, the internet has set down deep roots within society, letting humans communicate their experiences and opinions across the globe. However, an interesting phenomena that has reared it's head over the last couple of decades has been the differing opinions of professional critics and your average consumer when it comes to reviewing entertainment.\n",
